                                Hello, everyone! This is my family. As you can see in the photo, we’re eating together. We’re celebrating a Christmas dinner at home. I’m going to describe my family to you.  Well, let me start with my sister. Her name is Sofia. She’s the oldest in the family. She’s a nurse and she’s 45.  She is married too. Her husband’s name is Juan Pablo and he’s 48. He’s a doctor. They have a child and her name is Mariana. She’s only 5 years old. She’s a student in kindergarten. My mother’s name is Rosario and she is 72. She doesn’t work. She’s retired. I love her so much! My father isn’t in the picture because unfortunately, he died last year. His name was Mario. He was 76 years old and he was a Police officer.  I have two young brothers. Their names are Cristian and Paulo. Cristian is 23 and Paulo is 27.  Cristian studies Mechanical Engineering at UTP and Paulo works as a chef in a local restaurant. As for me, my name is Andrés. I’m 36 years old and I’m an English teacher at a public school. I love my job. What can you tell me about your family? 
                                </p>
